## Project Synopsis

The aim of the project is to implement a simple game of tic-tac-toe in the browser.  

## Learning Objectives

Specifically this project is about code organization and patterns to help implement
 features and code concepts independently.  
The module design patterns is completely new to me, but I am already somewhat 
 familiar with the factory design pattern.  
Like most of these projects the aim is to implement the project using both patterns.
